# LUPE Analysis Tool - Python Dependencies
#
# IMPORTANT: These versions are pinned to match the reference repository
# to ensure compatibility with the pre-trained A-SOiD model.
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Recommended: Use a virtual environment
#   python -m venv env
#   env\Scripts\activate  (Windows)
#   source env/bin/activate  (macOS/Linux)
#   pip install -r requirements.txt

# CRITICAL LIBRARIES (pinned for model compatibility)
# ============================================================================
# These versions are chosen for model compatibility while ensuring wheels
# are available for all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux)

# Machine Learning - Using 1.2.1 (matches the A-SOiD pre-trained model version)
# IMPORTANT: The pre-trained model was trained with sklearn 1.2.1 and is INCOMPATIBLE
# with sklearn 1.3.0+ due to breaking changes in tree node structure (missing_go_to_left field)
# DO NOT upgrade to 1.3.x as it will cause model loading failures
scikit-learn==1.2.1

# Core Scientific Computing

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 1. scikit-learn 1.2.1 is REQUIRED to match the pre-trained A-SOiD model version
#    - The model has sklearn 1.2.1 dependencies baked into its pickle format
#    - sklearn 1.3.0+ has breaking changes (missing_go_to_left field) that prevent loading
#    - If pip install fails on Windows, use: pip install --prefer-binary scikit-learn==1.2.1
#    - OR use conda: conda install scikit-learn=1.2.1
# 2. If you encounter installation issues, try: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
# 3. NumPy 2.0+ has breaking changes - stay on 1.26.4
# 4. Verify versions after install: pip list | findstr "numpy scikit-learn"
# 5. Python 3.11.x is recommended. Python 3.13+ may have compatibility issues.
